First off, *thank you!*

I mean this. This... I mean, *wow.*

Yes - first we do have to acknowledge that we didn't *technically* meet our arbitrary and self-defined goal of $5M by July 4th. But do you realize how much we *have* accomplished? We raised $1M in 13 days to begin with, and $4M in pledges isn't anything to sneeze at. 

### **We've proved to naysayers and doubters that, yes, Americans care about this issue and they are willing and able to act on it.**

That's something that nobody inside the Beltway understood before now. And if they still don't understand it, they're in for a very rude awakening indeed. More than that, we've proven it to ourselves. 

Back in April, when I told friends that we were going to raise money to solve the problem of big-money politics, the answer was a universal: "Sheah, good luck with that, (moron.)" But more often I'm seeing people start to believe that we really can get this done. And if we've awakened America to the fact that, yes, this is a solvable problem, then there's no doubt in my mind that it will be solved. 

### I suppose what I'm trying to say is: *Oh my god, you guys are awesome.*

But we can't sit down and congratulate ourselves for too long. Ahead is a road filled with hard choices, hard battles, and most of all, hard work. And while we will celebrate our victory - and it was a victory - we still have some things we need to do. 

### In the short term, here's what's going to happen.

1. Everyone who made a contingent pledge will get an e-mail. That e-mail will contain a link to a page where, *if and only if they wish,* they may choose to turn their contingent pledge into a donation.

2. On midnight, July 7th, we'll assume that anyone who hasn't clicked that link (or opened the e-mail) will get their refunds back on whatever credit or debit card they choose. We'll process them as quickly as possible, but right now we can only refund pledges manually (we're working on ways to automate the process but haven't found one yet.) We hope it'll take less than 24 hours, but if it takes longer, we'll keep you updated. 

3. After all of that is concluded, we'll be able to come to a final number, figure out how much we've raised, how far we have to go, and keep working towards it.

### What does it mean that we didn't make the $5M goal? 

Well, all things considered, it would have been better to have made it, but not making it isn't a disaster. 

If we had reached the $5M goal, we would have been guaranteed a match from our matching donors. Now, we'll still *try* to get whatever funds are conditionally donated matched, but we don't have any agreements or guarantees to that effect. We'll see what happens. 

It also means that we're going to have to place fundraising on a high priority up to election day. Having raised the full $12M would have meant that we could spend less time thinking about how to get to $12M and more time thinking about how to build social networks, how to get out the vote, how to spread the message. Since we still have to raise a few more million before the end, we're going to have to ask you - who have already supported us so much - to help us do these things.

If you have an idea, and you think it's good - you don't need our permission, just get out there and go for it. We'll try to help as much as we can but ultimately, what will make this movement work is what we can do on the ground, across the United States. And even if you're not in one of the five districts where the money we've raised together will be in play, we still want to flip other districts to pro-reformers and prime the pump for 2016. 

So, yeah, we've all got a lot of hard work to do if we want to fix this country's ailments, but I think these past two months have proved that we're up to the task.  

I'm going to close with one of my favorite quotes: **"We've done the impossible, and that makes us mighty."**
