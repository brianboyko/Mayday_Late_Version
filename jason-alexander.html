og_title: Look who just joined Mayday! Listen to what Jason Alexander has to say about #MAYDAY
og_description: You know Jason Alexander as “George” from Seinfeld, but I know him as an activist working with many to get Americans to focus on our need to get our democracy back... The idea of “a Super PAC to end all Super PACs” is magic to a frustrated and angry America. We just need to get them to focus on it for a minute, and then we will get their support."

Jason Alexander (of stage, screen &amp; Seinfeld) has decided to endorse the Mayday PAC. We're fighting campaign finance corruption by raising money to send politicians to Congress if they'll promise to get the money out of politics. Embrace the irony.
