## Government has failed us.

## More than 90% of Americans link that failure to the influence of money in politics.

**Yet the politicians do not talk about this influence. While our democracy decays, they spend endless time with their funders.**

**These funders hold our democracy hostage.**

**We want to pay the ransom and get it back.**

**We're kick-starting a SuperPAC big enough to make it possible to win a Congress committed to fundamental reform by 2016.**

**Here’s how we’ll do it: We set fundraising goals, and then crowdfund those goals.** 

**We only keep your pledge if we hit our goal.**

**For 2014, our goal is $12 million. With that money, we will make fundamental reform the key issue in five congressional races. And win.**

**Then we’ll apply what we learn to 2016 — when we’ll run a much much bigger campaign in many more districts with for this one purpose: to win a Congress committed to fundamental reform.**

## $1 Million

In May, we set a goal of raising $1 million dollars. We surpassed that goal in two weeks. And we secured a match from individual donors, totalling over $2 million in Stage One.

## $5 Million

Now, we've set an even more ambitious goal. Starting June 4, we're aiming to raise a total of $5 million, in increments of $1 million, by July 4. Each million dollar milestone will unlock another million dollar goal, until we reach $5 million.
