A Crowdfunded, Kickstarted SuperPAC to end all SuperPACs.

## Government has failed us.

### And more than 90% of Americans link that failure to the influence of money in politics.

Yet the politicians do not talk about this influence. While our democracy decays, they spend endless time with their funders.

These funders hold our democracy hostage. We want to pay the ransom and get it back.

### We're kickstarting a SuperPAC big enough to make it possible to win a Congress committed to fundamental reform by 2016.

We will set goals. We only keep the funds you pledge if we hit our goals. Unless there's enough to make a difference, you don't pay. And we're committed to securing a match for every goal.

For 2014, our goal is to raise $12 million and use it to make fundamental reform the key issue in five congressional races. And we'll apply what we learn then to 2016.

## $1 Million

In May, we set a goal of raising $1 million dollars. We surpassed that goal in two weeks. And we secured a match from individual donors, totalling over $2 million in Stage One.

## $5 Million

Now, we've set an even more ambitious goal. Starting June 4, we're aiming to raise a total of $5 million, in increments of $1 million, by July 4. Each million dollar milestone will unlock another million dollar goal, until we reach $5 million.

### Help us celebrate a true independence day by pledging what you can so that we can declare independence from a broken political system.
