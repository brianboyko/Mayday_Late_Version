America's operating system -- democracy -- is broken, and it will take the Internet down with it. Until we fix the fatal flaw of big money in our democracy, we'll continue to fight threat after threat to a free and open Internet.

MAYDAY is a crowdfunded, kickstarted Super PAC to end Super PACs. Help us reach our goal of $5 million by July 4th so that we can declare independence from our broken, corrupt campaign finance system. We only keep the money if we hit our goal. If we don't you get your money back. If we do, we get our democracy back.
