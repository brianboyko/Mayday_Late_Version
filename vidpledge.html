We're crowdfunding and kickstarting a Super PAC to end Super PACs. In May, we set an impossible goal -- to raise $1 million from ordinary citizens fed up with our broken democracy -- and we did it in two weeks.

This month, our goal is even more impossible: $5 million by July 4th. Join this experiment, and let's declare independence from this critical flaw in our democracy.

Pledge now -- we'll only collect if we hit our goal. If we don't, you get your money back. If we do, you get your democracy back.
