We were mulling over different ideas and wanted to pass on some to you and the team. 
Re: the Progress Bar. - Even though we're not guaranteed a "staged match" at each $1M, I would recommend having the Progress bar contain "checkpoints" regardless at every $1M.  

Instead of guaranteeing the match at every $1M, we could partner with various celebrities and organizations to put out "bonuses" that will be released at every checkpoint.  For example, we may have Jason Alexander and Joshua Gordon-Levitt produce a video for us.  Instead of releasing it immediately, we could promise to release it as soon as the progress bar hits a "checkpoint."  This gives people a reason to pledge even if they don't believe the $5M will be completed.  

Here are some ideas for celebrities and organizations we could reach out to:

-- Rooster Teeth/Red v. Blue (Based in Austin, TX, Shannon McCormick [who plays the star of Project Freelancer,] could hook me up with the creators of Red Vs. Blue.)
-- Adam Savage/Mythbusters (I've gotten in touch with Mr. Savage before via Metafilter for my 2007 project, "Makers," and it may be possible to get in contact with him again.)  
-- Wil Wheaton 
-- John Hodgman
-- Gabe Newell/Valve Software (Newell actually does a good job of answering his e-mail. One thing that might be doable would be if Newell could promise to hold their upcoming Steam Summer Sale early if we reach, say $4M.  Last year, the Steam Sale was launched on July 11th, so aiming for late June might be doable.)
-- Humble Bundle (Developers could tie their software to pledges) 
-- Cards against Humanity (Strongly in favor of reform, can release a card pack for a low checkpoint - maybe $1M) The game is available under a non-free Creative Commons license BY-NC-SA.
-- Lauren Faust (Creator of children's cartoons, notably Powerpuff Girls & My Little Pony - very strong internet following) 
-- Michael Moore
-- Matt Stone and Trey Parker 
-- Schmoyoho (Songify the News)
-- Bad Lip Reading (Bad Lip Reading)
-- George RR Martin - One idea with him specificially is to have him hold a character in his famous "Game of Thrones" series for ransom.  "If you fail to meet the $5M goal, I will kill off (fan-favorite) Tyrion Lannister in the last book."
